This is for QA's
as I set the base
to make up these tests
and automate this phase
Testing the mobile
with java a while
as the tests keep passing
and they start too pile
This what I forgot
say Appium.. did not
I just messed it up
got your feelings shot
Cypress on the web
running on the tab
as tests start to pass
there is nothing red
The plugins are beset
some commands ain‚Äôt yet
as we write the logic
the automation is set
With Java and Selenium
start running Appium
as we check the cases
end up in Medium

All the unique IDs
in the iOS piece
setting up the accessibility
to MobileBy with ease
Back to the JS
as we run Cypress
waiting up for the email
40 tries or less
Thank god we set up
test ids are up
same in all devices
that‚Äôs what I call luck
Double the progress
as we solved this mess
we just keep up testing
while returning tasks
The functionality is fine
the UI should incline
create another issue
if devs don't have time

Bug or feature that
I don't know it yet
we will find this out
as the question is set
New methods of tests
making all this stress
integration of the system
is smoke or regress?
Proud of all this
since we do not miss
any bug out here
we do not dismiss
Appium and Cypress
app and web in progress
as automation is testing
improving the process
This is from within
as I wrote it in
please don't test this up
bugs are coming in‚Ä¶. _by Arber Shabani_
